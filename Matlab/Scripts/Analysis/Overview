The core of the pipeline is the matched filtering stage. It generates a local replica of the expected PRACH preamble, which is a Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence defined by parameters in 3GPP TS 38.211.8 The script then performs a convolution of the received signal with the time-reversed conjugate of this template. The output is a Power Delay Profile (PDP), where peaks indicate the presence of a preamble at a specific time delay. The location of the peak corresponds to the TA, and its phase reveals the RAPID.
