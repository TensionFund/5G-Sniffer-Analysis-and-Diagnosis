I. GNB IMPLEMENTATION WITH SRSRAN PROJECT

The foundation of the testbed is a 5G gNB compiled and run using the srsRAN Project software suite. This section details the build process, configuration, and execution of the gNB application.

A. Build Process

The srsRAN Project is built from the source code using CMake. The following steps are performed to compile the software:

Clone the official srsRAN Project repository:

Bash
    
    git clone https://github.com/srsRAN/srsRAN_Project.git

Create a build directory and compile the source code using the make utility. The -j$(nproc) flag is used to parallelize the compilation across all available processor cores.

Bash

    cd srsRAN_Project
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make -j$(nproc)

This process generates the gNB application binary, which is located at srsRAN_Project/build/apps/gnb/ [5].

B. YAML Configuration

The gNB is configured via a YAML file. For this implementation, an example configuration file, gnb_usrp_n78_00101.yaml, is adapted. TABLE I outlines the critical parameters that must be set for proper operation and interoperability with the 5G Core (5GC) and the data capture system.

TABLE I <br>
GNB CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
</div>
Parameter Path	Example Value	Description & Rationale
amf.addr	127.0.0.1	IP address of the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF). Set to localhost if the 5GC is on the same machine [10].
ru_sdr.device_args	type=b200,clock=external	Arguments for the UHD driver. type=b200 is for the USRP B210. clock=external is mandatory for synchronization via a 10 MHz reference [10].
ru_sdr.srate	23.04	RF sample rate in MHz, a base rate derived from 3GPP numerology.
cell_cfg.dl_arfcn	632628	Downlink Absolute Radio-Frequency Channel Number, defining the cellâ€™s center frequency [10].
cell_cfg.band	78	NR operating band. Band 78 (n78) is a common TDD band for private 5G testing [12].
prach.prach_ConfigurationIndex	160	Defines preamble format and time/frequency resources for PRACH occasions per 3GPP TS 38.211 [13].

C. Execution Command

The gNB application requires root privileges to enable real-time thread scheduling for deterministic performance. From the build directory (srsRAN_Project/build/apps/gnb/), the gNB is executed as follows:

Bash
    
    sudo ./gnb -c gnb_usrp_n78_00101.yaml
